                <p>Taylor Wiley is an IT professional and artist who experiments in different analog and digital mediums. 
                    She is inspired by things such as, but not limited to: retro video and computer games (the more obscure the better), 
                    80s and 90s anime, weird thrift store finds, endless music rabbit holes, and random art books found in libraries and local bookstores. 
                    She currently splits her time between South Bend, Indiana and the Kalamazoo, Michigan area. </p>
